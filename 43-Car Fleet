There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is target miles away.

You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.


class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        pair=[(p,s) for p,s in zip(position,speed)]          "we make it a pair so it is easier to process later calculating t for each car"
        pair.sort(reverse=True)                              "we sort in reverse so the car that is ahead of all cars in terms of position is added to stack first and lastly the car at position 0"
        stack=[]
        
        for p,s in pair:
            stack.append((target-p)/s)                        "we calculate time of arrival for each car"
            if len(stack)>=2 and stack[-1]<=stack[-2]:        "if the car at the back has less time than the front car it means that it is going to catch up and hence a fleet"
                stack.pop()                                   "we remove that element from top of the list so we can cmpare the next car with it's car ahead"
        return len(stack)                                     "the number of cars remainig in the stack show the number of fleets"
