Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

bit manipulation time complexity O(1)

class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        while b!=0:            "this is the remaining value that we continue operation until this is zero- remaining happens only when we have both 1"
            temp=(a & b)<<1    "we store remaining in temp variable and we shift it to the left because remaining should be added to the previous value"
            a=a^b              "xor operation- is 1 when one of them is 1 else 0"
            b=temp
        return a
