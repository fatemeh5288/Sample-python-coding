#Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
#You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Time complexity is O(logn)

def search(nums):
    lo=0                          "define two pointers lo and hi"
    hi=len(nums)-1
    while lo<hi:
        mid=(lo+hi)//2
        if target>nums[mid]:      "each time we compare the target value to the mid point because it is a sorted array"
            lo=mid+1              "if targer is larger than mid point, this means that every element from mid to the left can be eliminated"
        if target<nums[mid]:
            hi=mid-1

            return mid
