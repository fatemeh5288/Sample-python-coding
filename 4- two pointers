#A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all 
#non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.
#Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.
